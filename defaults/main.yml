# This user will own the forwarder installation and config files and the `splunkd` process will also run as this user.  If the
# user doesn't exist, this role creates a user/group as the above with a no-login shell.  The default is to create a new splunk
# user and rely on logs having world read access for this setup to work.   Note that if you don't use root, you can't read
# syslog.  See http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Installation/RunSplunkasadifferentornon-rootuser for
# requirements to run as a less privileged user.

# Installations are done via the "universal" binary method instead of relying on the RPM or DEB package - it's easier to
# install from the binary and it should work beyond RedHat/CentOS and Debian systems
